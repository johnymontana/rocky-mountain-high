<p>(for example: Turing, Galvanize/gSchool, RefactorU, Skill Distillery, General Assembly, DaVinci Coders, etc.)</p>
<p><span>WHO ARE YOU? A prospective student of one of the aforementioned academic training programs. You should know that there are some essential skills and tools that can help ANYONE interested in learning how to program, write code, understand code, become a developer/engineer, make a website or app, etc. It is my belief that those skills should not cost any money to learn. So, bring your laptop (windows/mac/other) and a willingness to learn and I will show you some things.</span></p>
<p><span>WHO AM I? I am a graduate of the legendary Turing School of Software and Design (</span><a href=""http://turing.io"" class=""linkified"">http://turing.io</a><span>) run by Sensei Jeff Casimir who also started the program at gSchool aka Galvanize. It's a 7-month-long, 70-hour-per-week intensive coding school (they eschew the term 'bootcamp', but that's essentially what it is). They teach Object Oriented Programming, the Ruby Language, the Rails and Sinatra frameworks, client-side JavaScript, HTML/CSS/Sass, and a lot of other stuff. Before I went to Turing I knew next to nothing about programming, and now I have discovered a love and passion for programming which I hope to share with you.</span></p>
<p><span>WHY AM I DOING THIS? I knew almost nothing about programming before I went to Turing, and upon arriving I found myself woefully unprepared for what was to come (read: crying). I made it through the program, but it was insanely stressful and difficult to keep pace. I hope to share valuable knowledge that I gained from my experiences at Turing with you prospective developers, so that you can be more successful than I was when you enroll in a coding school. Also, if you are unsure whether or not to enroll in one of these so-called coding schools, or whether or not you should pursue software development as a career in general, my goal is to help you figure out if that path is right for you. This meetup is intended for true beginners: People with little to no knowledge of computer programming who are interested in learning how to do it.</span></p>
<p><span>WHAT WILL WE COVER:</span></p>
<p><span>Setting up your environment - Installing all the stuff you need to program on your computer and to do it well. It's a LOT of installing and I can walk you through this step by step.</span></p>
<p><span>Using the Command Line - I use a mac so the language is called UNIX but basically, it's that black MSDOS/Matrix screen where badass hackers in movies enter all sorts of hacker stuff. Also, it's being able to move around your computer without relying on the stupid trackpad/mouse...and to do that you need to learn keyboard shortcuts and common commands.</span></p>
<p><span>What is Programming? - I am no expert, but I understand how the web works, how to write a program that works on the web, common patterns and techniques for writing code, the basic building blocks of modern web-based languages, and a lot of other things that can help you really conceptualize what you are doing, so you can get the most learning value out of doing it.</span></p>
<p><span>Is Programming Bootcamp right for ME? - Programming is not for everyone. My aforementioned teacher Jeff likes to say that a lot. It's true. Also, it's really difficult to know whether or not you should do something before you actually do it. Wouldn't it be nice to practice, for FREE, to get an idea if this is something you can spend innumerable hours of your life doing in exchange for money?</span></p>
<p><span>...and other topics as they arise. You know. Basic shit. Hope to see you there! (:</span></p>","Jai Misra",186372478

<p>The Code Retreat format was developed by Corey Haines and others. The essence of the format is that people pair-program on a problem for 45 minutes then throw away their code, take a short break, switch partners and repeat the process. Classically, these are full-day events including 6 programming sessions, a long lunch, and beer afterwards. In this group, we will meet in the evening and probably do just two sessions.</p>
<p>The primal Code Retreat problem is Conway's Game of Life - it's an interesting problem in that it admits a wide variety of solutions and is simple enough that one can usually almost (but not quite) write a complete implementation in 45 minutes. While we're starting off this group working on Life (at least for the first meetup) my hope is that we expand the scope to work on other problems of similar size, complexity, and that support a similar variety of approaches to their solution. Some possibilities include small parsers, interpreters, Project Euler problems, and other such challenges.</p>

We meet regularly to work on maps, learn about geospatial data, and teach each other the latest cartographic tools. Maptime is, rather literally, time for mapmaking. Our mission is to open the doors of cartographic possibility to anyone interested by creating a time and space for collaborative learning, exploration, and map creation using mapping tools and technologies.</p>
<p>This open learning environment for all levels and degrees of knowledge offers intentional support for the beginner. Maptime is simultaneously flexible and structured, creating space for workshops, ongoing projects with a shared goal, and independent/collaborative work time. Inspiration for Maptime comes from both hack nights and knitting circles. Both are models of spaces for people to create and learn together. Our goal is to provide this space with an open heart and without pretension. You can bring your own projects to work on, or just hang out and socialize or ask questions. Some people are experts, and some people are just getting started, but all of us are learning, so why not do it together?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maptime is hands-on, so don't forget to bring your laptop! All skill levels are welcome. Newbies are especially welcome!
